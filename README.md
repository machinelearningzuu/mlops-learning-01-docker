## Introduction

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is all about streamlining the deployment and management of machine learning models. Docker plays a crucial role in this process by allowing you to package your ML applications, dependencies, and environment into lightweight containers.

## Getting Started with Docker

Before diving into MLOps, make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If not, follow the official installation guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Docker Basics

### What is Docker?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It allows you to separate your applications from the underlying infrastructure, making it easier to deliver software quickly.

### Key Concepts

- **Images**: Read-only templates for creating containers. Images can be based on other images and are defined using a `Dockerfile`.
- **Containers**: Runnable instances of an image. Containers can be created, started, stopped, moved, and deleted. They are lightweight compared to virtual machines (VMs).
- **Docker Engine**: The core component that handles creating and managing containers.
- **Docker Registry**: Stores Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub).

## Creating Docker Images

To create a Docker image for your ML application, follow these steps:

1. Write a `Dockerfile` that specifies the instructions for building your image.
2. Build the image using `docker build`.
3. Tag the image with a meaningful name and version.
4. Push the image to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

## Running Containers

Once you have your Docker image, you can run containers based on it. Use the following command:

```bash
docker run -i -t your-image-name /bin/bash
```

Remember to replace `your-image-name` with the actual name of your Docker image.

## Best Practices

- Keep your images lightweight.
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size.
- Leverage Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications.
